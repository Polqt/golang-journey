# Go Environment Setup 🛠️

Get your machine ready for Go development in minutes!

---

## 1. Install Go

- Download from [golang.org/dl](https://golang.org/dl/)
- Follow the installer for your OS (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Confirm install:
	```sh
	go version
	```

---

## 2. Set Up Your Editor

- Recommended: VS Code + [Go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go)
- Other good options: GoLand, Vim, Neovim

---

## 3. Configure PATH (if needed)

- The Go installer usually sets this up
- If not, add Go’s `bin` folder to your PATH

---

## 4. Useful Go Tools

- `gofmt` — auto-format your code
- `go run` — run Go files quickly
- `go mod` — manage dependencies

---

## 5. Test Your Setup

```go
package main
import "fmt"
func main() { fmt.Println("Go is ready!") }
```

Run it:
```sh
go run yourfile.go
```

You’re ready to Go! 🚀
