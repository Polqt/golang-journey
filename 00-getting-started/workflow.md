## 🗂️ Structure

- Each week/folder = a focused topic (basics, algorithms, OOP, etc.)
- Each week has:
  - `exercises/` — practice problems
  - `projects/` — small real-world projects

---

## 🔁 Recommended Habits

- Tackle one week at a time
- Do exercises before peeking at solutions
- Build and run code often
- Take notes on what’s tricky or new
- Refactor and experiment with your solutions

---

## 🚦 How to Use This Repo

1. Pick a week/topic
2. Read the README in that folder
3. Work through exercises, then try the project
4. Commit your progress (even small wins!)
5. Review, refactor, and move to the next topic

## 💡 Tips

- Use `go run` for quick tests
- Use `go fmt` to auto-format code
- Don’t be afraid to break things—experimentation is key!

Happy coding and learning! 🚀
