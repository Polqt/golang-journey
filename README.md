This repository documents my personal journey learning **Golang deeply**, from the basics to building real, production-grade systems.

The goal isn’t just to “learn Go syntax,” but to understand **how Go is used in the real world**: concurrency, backend services, distributed systems, and cloud-native infrastructure.

This is a living repo. It will evolve, break, get fixed, and (hopefully) improve over time.

## 🎯 Why This Repo?

- Learn Go the *right* way: by building, experimenting, and reading real systems
- Document progress and thinking, not just finished code
- Create a long-term reference for myself (and others!)
- Learn in public and stay consistent
