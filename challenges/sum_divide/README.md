# Sum and Divide

**Difficulty:** Easy

Write a function that takes two numbers, calculates the sum of all numbers between them (inclusive), and divides that sum by the sum of the two entered numbers.

## Example
For the numbers `4` and `10`:

1. Calculate the sum of all numbers between 4 and 10:
	```
	4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 49
	```
2. Divide this sum by the sum of the two entered numbers:
	```
	49 / (4 + 10) = 3.5
	```

**Result:**
```
3.5
```
