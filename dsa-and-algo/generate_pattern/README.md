# Generate Pattern

**Difficulty:** Easy

Write a function that takes a number `n` and prints a descending pattern of numbers, starting from 1 up to `n`, with each subsequent line one number shorter.

## Requirements
- If `n > 10`, print: `The number should be less than 10`.
- If `n <= 10`, print the pattern as shown below.

## Example
For `n = 8`, the output should be:

```
12345678
1234567
123456
12345
1234
123
12
1
```
